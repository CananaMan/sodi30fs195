You're free to modify the code and use it for whatever you want, but all other assets (Images, sounds, music, text messages in the code, other media) belong to me(CananaMan)
When using the code, it's not required, but I encourage you to type the code in rather than copy paste it as it helps you find the bugs and learn the language faster.
When in doubt of what you can use, or if you want to use a non-code asset, ask permission.
